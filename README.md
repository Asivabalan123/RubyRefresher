# RubyRefresher

This project consisted of working with the ordering of Arrays and integer-indexed collections of objects. Successful testable code was created for pre-defined questions in the array_spec.rb. The same testable code was carried out for the pre-defined questions within the hash_spec.rb. This was similar to the arrays, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
